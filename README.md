## Detailed Guide

### Installing WireGuard

The script detects your operating system and installs WireGuard using the appropriate package manager:

```bash
sudo wg-manager install
```

### Configuring the Server

The configuration process will prompt you for the necessary information, providing sensible defaults:

```bash
sudo wg-manager config
```

You'll be asked for:
- Public IP address (auto-detected)
- Network interface (auto-detected)
- WireGuard interface name (default: wg0)
- Private subnet (default: 10.0.0.0/24)
- Server IP within the subnet (default: 10.0.0.1)
- UDP port (default: 51820)
- Client DNS server (default: 1.1.1.1)

### Adding Clients

To add a new client:

```bash
sudo wg-manager add-client
```

You'll be prompted for a client name, and the script will:
1. Generate keys and configurations
2. Add the client to the server config
3. Create a downloadable configuration file
4. Generate a QR code if `qrencode` is installed
5. Offer to restart the server to apply changes

### Managing the Server

**Starting the server:**
```bash
sudo wg-manager activate
```

**Stopping the server:**
```bash
sudo wg-manager deactivate
```

**Restarting the server:**
```bash
sudo wg-manager restart
```

**Checking server status:**
```bash
sudo wg-manager status
```

**Upgrading to the latest version:**
```bash
sudo wg-manager upgrade
```
This will check for updates, download the latest version, and create a backup of your current version before upgrading.

### Transferring Configurations

**Downloading a client config:**
```bash
sudo wg-manager download-conf
```

**Transferring a config between servers:**
```bash
sudo wg-manager transfer-conf
```

**Listing existing clients:**
```bash
sudo wg-manager list-clients
```

## Configuration Files

All configurations are stored in:
- Linux: `/etc/wireguard/`
- macOS: `/usr/local/etc/wireguard/`

Key files include:
- `wg0-server.conf`: Main server configuration
- `privatekey`, `publickey`: Server keys
- `server_vars`: Saved server variables for reuse
- `<client_name>.conf`: Client configurations
- `<client_name>.zip`: Zipped client configurations (if `zip` is installed)

## Client Setup

### Mobile Devices

1. Add a client using the script:
   ```bash
   sudo wg-manager add-client
   ```

2. If you have `qrencode` installed, a QR code will be displayed. Scan this QR code using the WireGuard mobile app on your device.

3. If you don't have `qrencode` installed, you can download the configuration file and manually import it:
   ```bash
   sudo wg-manager download-conf
   ```

### Desktop Clients

1. Add a client using the script:
   ```bash
   sudo wg-manager add-client
   ```

2. Download the configuration file:
   ```bash
   sudo wg-manager download-conf
   ```

3. Import the `.conf` file into your WireGuard client software.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the server status:
   ```bash
   sudo wg-manager status
   ```

2. Verify that your firewall allows UDP traffic on your configured port (default 51820)

3. If clients cannot connect, try restarting the server:
   ```bash
   sudo wg-manager restart
   ```

4. Ensure your server's public IP hasn't changed. If it has, you'll need to update client configurations.

5. Common issues:
    - **Client can't connect**: Check the server's public IP and port forwarding
    - **No internet on client**: Check the AllowedIPs and server's forwarding settings
    - **Connection drops**: Check the PersistentKeepalive setting (default is 25 seconds)

## Common Scenarios

### Setting up a new VPN server

```bash
sudo wg-manager install
sudo wg-manager config
sudo wg-manager add-client
sudo wg-manager activate
```

### Adding multiple clients

```bash
sudo wg-manager add-client  # Add first client
sudo wg-manager add-client  # Add second client
sudo wg-manager restart     # Only needed if you didn't restart after adding clients
```

### Checking if clients are connected

```bash
sudo wg-manager status
# Look for "Active Interface Details" section
```

### Updating after server IP changes

If your server's public IP changes:

1. Check the current status to see both IPs:
   ```bash
   sudo wg-manager status
   ```

2. You'll need to update client configurations or create new ones

## Security Considerations

- The script generates strong keys for both server and clients
- Private keys are stored with restricted permissions (600)
- Config directory permissions are restricted (700)
- For production use, consider implementing additional firewall rules
- Consider setting up regular backups of your configuration directory

## Platform Specific Notes

### Linux

- Ensure your kernel supports WireGuard (Linux kernel 5.6+ has built-in support)
- For older kernels, the script will install appropriate DKMS modules
- Make sure forwarding is enabled: `sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1`
- Check your distribution's firewall settings to allow the WireGuard UDP port

### macOS

- Requires Homebrew for installation
- May require sudo for most operations
- Network interface names will be different from Linux (en0, en1, etc.)
